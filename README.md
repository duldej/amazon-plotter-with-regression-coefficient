# amazon-plotter-with-regression-coefficient
Variation of Ship Station Plotter, but is capable of importing and manipulating Amazon sales data - has some bugs
known issue is that the chart in the pandas_chart_line output file is messed-up.  I had focused instead on the Regression_Analysis output file, and will get back to correct the chart when I get the chance.
